## Introduction

Data manipulation is a fundamental part of modern JavaScript development. This toolkit aims to provide developers with a clear understanding and practical examples of how to work with various data structures in JavaScript, enabling efficient data manipulation and management.

## Arrays

Arrays are the foundation of many data manipulation tasks in JavaScript. This section covers array manipulation techniques, including filtering, mapping, reducing, and other common operations.

## Typed Arrays

Typed Arrays are specialized arrays with a fixed data type, making them ideal for handling binary data efficiently. Learn about Int8Array, Uint32Array, Float64Array, and how to work with binary data effectively.

## Maps

Maps are key-value stores that allow for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Understand how to use Maps to associate keys with values, iterate through them, and perform lookups efficiently.

## Sets

Sets are collections of unique values, often used to eliminate duplicates or check for the existence of an item in a collection. Discover how to work with Sets and perform common set operations.

## Weak Maps

Weak Maps are similar to Maps but have unique characteristics, such as privacy and automatic garbage collection. Learn about their use cases and how to utilize Weak Maps in your projects.
